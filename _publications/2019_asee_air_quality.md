# Papers are ordered by year. However, in years with many papers, we want some ordering at a lower level. You can do 
# that by specifying an order for the papers of that year. For example, 2019-11 will put papers with values lower than 
# 2019-11 belwo that paper. Notice that sorting is lexicographic.

abstract: "<p>
Communities of citizen scientists have proven themselves to be capable of contributing to research endeavors in meaningful ways, and on a scale that would be impractical for any traditional research group. High-quality data collection by P12 citizen scientists presents one set of hurdles, which have been the subject of significant citizen scientist research. However, important questions remain on how to best engage the same students within more complex cognitive domains, such as hypothesis generation and validation.

We have recruited P12 classrooms to becomes hosts in a network of distributed air quality sensors, across a community which experience some of the worst air quality in the United States. These classroom-hosted sensors are integrated into an infrastructure called AQ&U that includes, in addition to the networked sensors, statistical models and visualizations for identifying and communicating pollution events at a community scale.

In this work we report on methods used to help students move from comprehension of their one sensor in one location, to analysis and evaluation of a vast network of data to which their one sensor contributes. Curated sets from impactful air quality events, including fireworks, wildfires, and inversions, are used in combination with visualization tools to advance students’ ability to generate and evaluate hypotheses about the air quality in their valley, and connect their conclusions to community governance. Survey and other observational data from classroom visits are used to assess the effectiveness of the developed teaching module and larger pre-college citizen scientist effort.
