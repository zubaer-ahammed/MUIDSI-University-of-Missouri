abstract: "
Visual cohort analysis utilizing electronic health record data has
become an important tool in clinical assessment of patient outcomes. In this
paper, we introduce Composer, a visual analysis tool for orthopedic surgeons to
compare changes in physical functions of a patient cohort following various
spinal procedures. The goal of our project is to help researchers analyze
outcomes of procedures and facilitate informed decision-making about treatment
options between patient and clinician. In collaboration with
Orthopedic surgeons and researchers, we defined domain-specific user
requirements to inform the design. We developed the tool in an iterative
process with our collaborators to develop and refine functionality. With
Composer, analysts can dynamically define a patient cohort using demographic
information, clinical parameters, and events in patient medical histories and
then analyze patient-reported outcome scores for the cohort over time, as well
as compare it to other cohorts. Using Composer's current iteration, we provide
a usage scenario for use of the tool in a clinical setting. We have
developed a prototype cohort analysis tool to help clinicians assess patient
treatment options by analyzing prior cases with similar characteristics. Though
Composer was designed using patient data specific to Orthopedic research, we
believe the tool is generalizable to other healthcare domains. A long term goal
for Composer is to develop the application into a shared decision-making tool
that allows translation of comparison and analysis from a clinician facing
interface into visual representations to communicate treatment options to
patients.
