We care about a friendly culture in our lab, so we have a series of activities to foster a collaborative atmosphere. You can get an impression on our <a href="https://goo.gl/photos/v1rN6bs6qBzSQYLL7">photo album</a>. Salt Lake City is a great place to do research, but also to play! Skiing, climbing, mountain biking, etc. is all immediately accessible in the vicinity. We have a [code of conduct](../conduct) that details how we expect our lab members to collaborate.

## Group Meetings

We meet weekly as a group to discuss a research paper, give feedback on research proposals, give test-talks for conferences, and build other soft-skills. Our meetings include all our PostDocs and PhD students, but also MS and BS students interacting with the group.

## Group Retreat

Once a year we go on a hike and meet for food and drinks at Miriah's or Alex' house afterwards. Here are some pictures from these events.
