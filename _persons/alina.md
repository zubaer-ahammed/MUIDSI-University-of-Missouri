Hello! My name is Alina Rohulia, I am an international student from Ukraine. I am studying Health Infromatics at the University of Missouri-Columbia and working as a Graduate Research Assistant at the MU Institute for Data Science and Informatics in Dr. Chi-Ren Shyu's lab. My main research interests are health informatics, machine learning, and study of autism spectrum disorder using data science tools.
