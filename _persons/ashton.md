Hi! I'm Ashton Wooster, an undergraduate student researcher at Mizzou majoring in Computer Science and Information Technology. My research focus is in secure computation for quantum computing. I also serve as the ACM student chapter president at the university and the vice president of finance for the Engineering Student Council.
