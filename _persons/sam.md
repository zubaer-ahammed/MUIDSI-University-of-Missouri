Hey, I am Sam Spell. I am working on my graduate studies in Computer Science at the University of Missouri - Columbia. In my research, I am specifically interested in Quantum Computing, Cybersecurity, Geospatial Analytics, and Machine Learning. My mentor is Dr. Chi-Ren Shyu, and I work alongside other students interested in Geospatial Analytics and Quantum Computing. I completed my undergrad at the University of Missouri with a dual major in Mathematics and Computer Science. I enjoy competing in hackathons and working with groups on interesting interdisciplinary projects.
