I am Yu Li, a Ph.D. student in Computer Science. My research focuses on developing computational models inspired by human visual reasoning, with the aim of advancing both the theoretical understanding of perception and the practical capabilities of intelligent systems. Through closer study and modeling of the human mind, I believe these models can achieve not only higher performance but also more explainable and trustworthy predictions. I investigate how such approaches can be applied across diverse domains, including core computer vision tasks, medical imaging for improved diagnosis and treatment, and remote sensing for large-scale environmental and geospatial analysis.
