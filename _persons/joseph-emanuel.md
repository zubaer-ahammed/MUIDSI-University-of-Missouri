I am Joseph Emanuel, a PhD student in Informatics specializing in Geo-Informatics and Health Informatics. In addition to my studies, I am a recipient of the SFS Cybercorps Scholarship and Treasurer of the MUIDSI Graduate Student Organization. Currently, I collaborate with the Interdisciplinary Data Analytics and Search (iDAS) Lab under the supervision of my advisor, Prof. Dr. Chi-Ren Shyu. My research interests include Machine Learning, Geospatial Informatics, Bayesian Statistics, and Cybersecurity.
