Hi, Iâ€™m Deshan Wattegama. I am currently pursuing my PhD in Health Informatics at the University of Missouri. I work as a Graduate Research Assistant in the iDAS Lab and as a Graduate Teaching Assistant for MUIDSI. My research focuses on the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) in healthcare systems, with particular interests in social media data analysis and electronic health record analysis. Looking ahead, I plan to extend my work by exploring VR and AR technologies to enhance the quality and accessibility of healthcare.
