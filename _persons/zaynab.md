My name is Zaynab Shakkour, currently pursuing my PhD in Bioinformatics at the University of Missouri-Columbia. I moved to the US in 2021 for my graduate studies at Mizzou and earned my MS in Neuroscience in Summer 2024, where I focused on neurodevelopmental and rare genetic disorders. With passion for systems biology and integrative approaches, my long-term goal is to bridge the gap between biology and informatics by developing computational tools that provide deeper insights into disease mechanisms and support the advancement of precision medicine.
