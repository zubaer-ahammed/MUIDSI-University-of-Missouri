Heyo! I'm Jaden Hawley! I'm a computer science PhD student working on quantum computer security at the University of Missouri-Columbia. I am also the Vice President of the Quantum Technology, Information, and Computing (QTIC) Club at Mizzou. I got my BS and MS in computer science at Mizzou with an MI in mathematics. I enjoy everything quantum and have experience with networking, NLP, and bioinformatics as well.
